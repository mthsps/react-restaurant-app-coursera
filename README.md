# Front-End Web Development with React
Course from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology on Coursera by Professor Jogesh K. Muppala. It explores the React library, going through: 

1. React components and JSX; 
2. React Router and Single Page Applications design;
3. React Forms, Flow Architecture and Redux;
4. Client-Server Communication

As a hands-on course, throughout the modules, a restaurant application, called “ConFusion”, is built to put concepts learned into practice.  

# Assignments 

## Assignment 1

>  In this assignment you will add a new component to the React application to show the details of a selected dish. You will use the Card component and the Bootstrap unstyled list component to prepare the view for this new component.

## Assignment 2

> In this assignment you will continue working with the React application by adding a new component named AboutComponent to serve up the details of the corporate leaders, and you will then integrate the AboutComponent into the single page application.

## Assignment 3

> In this assignment you will be updating the React application with a react-redux-form based local form and do the form validation in code.

## Assignment 4
> In this assignment, you will update the web application to get data from the server to render the information corresponding to the leadership team of the company. In addition, you will handle the submission of the feedback form by posting the feedback to the server.

# Making it run

In the project directory, you can:

## `yarn install`

Installs the node modules needed to make the application work.

## `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

<br/>

In the *json-server* directory, you can:
## `npx json-server --watch db.json -p 3001 -d 2000`
